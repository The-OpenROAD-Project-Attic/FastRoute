# This repository is obsolete. FastRoute has been integrated into the OpenROAD repository

FastRoute
======================

**FastRoute** is an open-source global router.

If you want to use this as part of the OpenROAD project you should build it and use it from inside the integrated [openroad app](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD). The standalone version is available as legacy code.

The algorithm base is from FastRoute4.1, and the database comes from [OpenDB](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenDB)


The FastRoute4.1 version was received from <yuexu@iastate.edu> on June 15, 2019, with the BSD-3 open source license as given in the FastRoute [website](http://home.eng.iastate.edu/~cnchu/FastRoute.html#License).

## Getting Started
### Pre-Requisite

- GCC compiler
- boost library
- CMake3.1
- TCL
- Swig

### How to Compile

````
git clone --recursive https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/FastRoute4-lefdef
cd FastRoute/
make PARALLEL=nthreads
````
NOTE: use `PARALLEL=nthreads` instead of `-j nthreads`

### Basic Usage

##### Arguments

To properly run FastRoute there are a few mandatory arguments that must be defined:

- **l** : Input LEF file (e.g.: -l input.lef)
- **d** : Input DEF file (e.g.: -d input.def)
- **o** : Output Guides file, the name of the output file, where the routing guides will be saved (e.g.: -o output.guide)

There are optional flags that can be used:

- **a**: Global capacity adjustment (e.g.: -a 0.3)
- **n**: Minimum routing layer (e.g.: -n 2)
- **m** Maximum routing layer (e.g.: -m 9)
- **u** Unidirectional route (e.g.: -u true)

Command line example:

````
./FastRoute -l input.lef -d input.def -o output.guide -a 0.3 -n 2 -m 9 -u false
````

##### TCL commands

FastRoute also have support for TCL commands. These commands can be used through script or through a TCL shell.
Currently, the tool have extra options in TCL commands/shell in comparison with command line options.

To run FastRoute in interactive mode (TCL shell and TCL script), run the following command line:

````
./FastRoute -c 1
````

##### Load and write files
- **fr_import_lef** "path/to/file1.lef path/to/fileN.lef"
- **fr_import_def** "path/to/file1.def path/to/fileN.def"
- **set_output_file** "path/to/output.guide"

##### Modify tile size, global and region capacities, minimum and maximum routing layer and set unidirectional route
- **set_pitches_in_tile** num_tracks_per_tile (INTEGER)
- **set_capacity_adjustment** adjustment_percent (FLOAT)
- **set_layer_adjustment** layer (INTEGER) adjusment_percentage (FLOAT)
- **set_region_adjustment** lower_x (INTEGER) lower_y (INTEGER) upper_x (INTEGER) upper_y (INTEGER) layer (INTEGER) adjusment_percentage (FLOAT)
- **set_min_layer** layer_index (INTEGER)
- **set_max_layer** layer_index (INTEGER)
- **set_unidirectional_routing** BOOL

###### NOTE 1: if you set unidirectionalRoute as "true", the minimum routing layer will be assigned as "2" automatically
###### NOTE 2: the first routing layer of the design have index equal to 1
###### NOTE 3: ***set_layer_adjustment*** and ***set_region_adjustment*** can be called multiple times, creating a list of adjustments

##### Flow commands
- **start_fastroute:** Initialize FastRoute structures
- **run_fastroute:** Run only FastRoute4.1 algorithm, without write guides
- **write_guides:** Write guides file. Should be called only after ***run_fastroute***
- **run:** Run entire flow

## Fixes and modifications on FastRoute4 original code

- Project programming language from C to C++

- Added namespace “FastRoute” in all files
- Code organization:
    - License and folder hierarchy following Tim Ansell’s + Tom Spyru’s guidelines/suggestions
    - Added licence header (as per Iowa website) in each file owned by them
    - Added licence header (BSD-3) for new/created files

- Code clean-up:
    - Remove unused variables
        - Declared not assigned
        - Assigned not read
    - Indentation/code-style for readability

- Setting maximum number of routing layers to 18 \
 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;   **Previous setting**: Maximum of 8 routing layers \
 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;   **Reason**: Support for OpenRoad benchmarks

- Added auxiliary function to set layers preferred directions: \
  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  **Previous setting**: Hardcoded layers preferred directions \
  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  **Reason**: Set layers preferred directions according to each benchmark specification

- Added auxiliary function to get edges capacities \
   &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; **Previous setting**: Cannot get the capacity of a specific edge \
   &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; **Reason**: Access specific edge capacity to verify consistency in capacity adjustments

- Added auxiliary function to get all nets from FastRoute4 data structures \
   &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; **Previous setting**: Cannot access nets from FastRoute4 data structures \
   &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  **Reason**: Access nets added to FastRoute4 data structures in order to verify if all nets of the design were routed

- Increase maximum net name length \
  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  **Previous setting**: Nets added to FastRoute4 data structures can have at most 18 characters \
  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  **Reason**: Increasing net name limit to 200 characters, avoiding issues with net names of OpenRoad benchmarks

- Added flag in addAdjustments function allowing capacity increase \
  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  **Previous setting**: Capacities adjustments only decrease the original edges capacities \
  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  **Reason**: Allow edges capacities increase

- Removing net degree limitation for FastRoute4 \
  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  **Previous setting**: Nets can have at most 1000 pins, or they will be ignored \
  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  **Reason**: Dynamically memory allocation for data structures dependents on the nets degree, allowing nets to have any degree

- Removing net degree limitation for Flute \
  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  **Previous setting**: Nets can have at most 1000 pins, or generates a segfault \
  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  **Reason**: Dynamically memory allocation for data structures dependents on the nets degree, allowing nets to have any degree
